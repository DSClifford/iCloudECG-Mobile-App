#iCloudECG Mobile App

This application (Android) is for use with a wearable, single-lead heart monitor (currently BioHarness 3, but can easily be configured for others). The app displays the user's real-time ECG, heart rate, and breathing rate. Records, length of 30 seconds, are continuously collected and relayed to a server-side system (iCloudECG ServerSide & WebApp) for analysis, review, and long-term storage. 24 hours worth of records are also stored on the device for quick review. See http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_gradthes/3571/ for details about the system and it's applications.
